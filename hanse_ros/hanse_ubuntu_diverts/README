This directory contains changes to files installed by ubuntu binary packages.
Use "./update_divert.sh" to patch the files using dpkg-divert (this makes sure
that updating of the ubuntu packages doesn't break stuff).
Use "./update_divert.sh remove" to undo all changes. Both commands can safely
be run multiple times.
